# Oil Spill Simulation
The aim of this project is to simulate the event of an oil spill as accurately as possible to use it for developing oill spill detection and thickness estimation algorithms.


# To-Do

* Research about shallow water simulations
* Investigate all the mathematical tools that should be used to conduct an accurate simulation
* Decide on the proper parameters to use for the oil spill simulation
* Develop basic 2D simulation in python (Transition to C/C++ if performance is bad)
